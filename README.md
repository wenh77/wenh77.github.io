I am working at the [SENS group](https://github.com/wenh77/sens/wiki), [CSE](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/), [UNSW](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/) as an associate professor. My official website is available [here](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-wen-hu). Before this, I spent fantastic eight years at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au) Digital Productivity Flagship as a principal research scientist and research project and team leader in beautiful Brisbane.
